The Minnesota Geospatial Information Office created the initial CTU dataset by updating a municipal boundary file maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). Update information was gathered primarily from boundary adjustment records maintained by the Office of Administrative Hearings, Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit. MnDOT has maintained the file since 2014. 

Note: Cities and Townships represented in this dataset are political (civil) townships as recognized by the State of MN, not congressional or public land survey townships. Unorganized territory subdivisions are those defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, which often differ from those defined by a county.</abstract><purpose>This dataset is best suited for general reference only -- it is not suitable for precise land measurements or ground surveys. MnGeo created it as part of a legislatively mandated project to calculate a table of township acreage data for the Minnesota Department of Revenue in accordance with state statute (Chapter 366, Article 17, Section 7, Subd. 3). 

Note that several state agencies and government units maintain statewide CTU boundary and acreage data for their internal business needs. Though these data may meet the requirements of those individual agencies, there are no authoritative processes in place to provide a standard, regularly maintained universal data set for use by the GIS community at large. This data set is a step toward the long term goal of improving accuracy, standardizing attributes and maintaining statewide boundary and acreage data for ongoing use by the GIS community.</purpose><supplinf>State of Minnesota</supplinf></descript><timeperd><current>Data is published weekly to the GeoCommons, but maybe maintained on a different cycle.

The dataset is not intended for legal land survey use, and is best suited for general reference.  

General accuracy varies between features due to initial content creation and subsequent boundary adjustment updates.  There is a continual effort to capture each approved boundary change at the highest possible accuracy and then to adjust the surrounding area to match.  Features that have had recent approved adjustments are generally more accurate than features that have not been edited since the first data was created.  

Initial Data Accuracy when CTU data was first created: 

MnGeo staff compared the attributes created for this project (the mnctu09 feature class -- see Lineage field for description of how attributes were created) with the Minnesota CTU database (derived from the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System or GNIS). The checks were done using Esri's ArcSDE and ArcMap software:

1. Downloaded CTU records from the Minnesota CTU database: http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/CTU/index.html
2. Created CTU events (from the CTU records centroid X,Y coordinates) in ArcMap 
3. Spatially joined CTU events and mnctu09 feature class 
4. Checked and fixed mnctu09 types (e.g., city, township, unorganized territory) that were not equivalent to CTU event types 
5. Checked and fixed mnctu09 names that did not match CTU event names 
6. Expanded all abbreviations in mnctu09 names (e.g., St. to Saint, Mt. to Mountain) 
7. Verified that no blanks existed in any records (except 11 unorganized territories that did not have GNIS_IDs)
</attraccr></attracc><logic>In the original dataset, MnDOT's more up-to-date dataset for city, township and unorganized territory boundaries was merged with MnGeo's updated boundary data. The resulting gaps and overlaps were manually fixed to produce a seamless statewide dataset.

In 2010, MnGeo received a CAP grant to investigate methods for improving data accuracy working in an ArcSDE geodatabase environment. The following is a summary of the methods used to create the updated CTU boundary dataset:

1. Set up ArcSDE Geodatabase. 
2. Created a feature dataset that includes a line (CTU_l), annexation polygon (CTU_Edits), and city, township and unorganized territory polygon base file (CTU_p).
3. Created annexation lines using advanced COGO tools  in Arc Editor. Line files were created using both as-read survey descriptions and digitized georeferenced maps. The line files were saved as Traverse files and rotated when necessary to adjust to PLS 40 and other base layer reference maps. 
4. Constructed annexation polygons (CTU_Edits) from the line files  (CTU_l) and unioned, then dissolved the polygons with the most recent CTU dataset (mnctu062310). 
5. Created topology rules to eliminate gaps and overlaps and recalculated acreage.
6. Exported CTU_p to a shapefile and named it mnctu090110.</logic><complete>The current CTU dataset is continually updated to include all offically approved municipal boundary changes by the Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit (http://www.mba.state.mn.us/) as of the content date in the metadata record. 

Township and Unorganized Territory changes generally come from townships and counties via the MnDOT status update process.  Other changes come from state and federal government sources (demographers offices, US census, state agencies, etc.)

Historical completeness: 

MnDOT's municipal boundary file was selected to be used as the original basemap to update MBA boundary changes because, compared to other available sources, it provided the most comprehensive statewide boundary and acreage coverage and had more recent annexation boundary information.

The most current statewide boundary and acreage coverage, mnctu072011, was used as the basemap to update MBA boundary changes. 

Total records:   2747
Cities: 900
Townships: 1785
Unorganized Territories: 62

The GNIS code for 9 unorganized territory records could not be found in the CTU database or on the GNIS website so they were assigned fictitous numbers (999901-999911). Unorganized territories sometimes do not have the same names and boundaries between the two primary sources for their data: individual counties and the U.S. Census Bureau. Therefore, GNIS codes are not established for those with discrepancies. To facilitate joins and relates, fictititious GNIS codes (999901-999911) were assigned.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>All of the data sources reviewed and the final dataset were within the National Map Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000-scale maps which is +/- 40 feet (12 meters).

General accuracy varies between features due to initial content creation and subsequent boundary adjustment updates.  There is a continual effort to capture each approved boundary change at the highest possible accuracy and then to adjust the surrounding area to match.  Features that have had recent approved adjustments are generally more accurate than features that have not been edited since the first data was created.  

When the data was originally created by MnGeo, the positional accuracy of annexation data varies depending on the quality of the submitted data and the method used to enter the data:

1. When the legal descriptions in the MBA dockets were complete, boundaries could often be entered by using Esri's Traverse COGO (coordinate geometry) tool which is likely to produce the most accurate results.

2.  Dockets that could not be mapped using the Traverse tool were georeferenced and digitized using aerial photography and Public Land Survey 40 quarter-quarter section lines. The quality of the boundary data digitized from georeferenced maps varies depending on the scale and quality of the scanned raster image of the map.

3. Some maps obtained from MBA were digitized based on intent and interpreted using area measurements and relative positions of hand-drawn features on the docket maps and their approximate geospatial relationship to landmarks on aerial photos and roads. In these cases, the areas mapped may be less accurate than data entered using georeferenced maps or the Traverse tool.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>Not Applicable</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale>24000</srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>OVERVIEW:

The Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo), formerly the Minnesota Land Management Information Center (LMIC), created this file by updating a municipal boundary file maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). Update information was gathered primarily from annexation and detachment records maintained in the 'docket' system of the Office of Administrative Hearings, Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit (MBA):  http://www.mba.state.mn.us
Since 2014, MnDOT has maintained this file.

Depending on the quality of information provided, different processes were used to update and check the data.

-----------------------------------
PROCESS FOR INITIAL DATASET CREATION, April 2009 version

SOURCE DATA:

A. Data file used as a starting point:

MnDOT Municipal (City) Boundaries shapefile (muni_bounds) with updated annexation data through February 2008 (MnDOT was missing approximately 50 annexation dockets from after Feb. 08): Contains city boundary updates based on annexation data received from MBA.

This 2008 version of the data set was prepared for internal use at MnDOT. For documentation of the 2001 version of this data set (MnDOT BaseMap Muni) which is currently the most recent version publicly available online, see:  http://www.dot.state.mn.us/maps/gdma/data/metadata/muni.htm


B. Sources used to check and update the muni_bounds data set:

1. MnDOT All_boundaries shapefile
Contains boundary data for cities, townships, and unorganized territories.

2. MnDOT updated municipal boundary data table (Excel format)
Lists all recent (through February 2008) municipal boundary annexation dockets that MnDOT had completed or planned to complete.

3. Municipal Boundary Adjustments (MBA) docket data
Approved annexation and detachment dockets that include legal descriptions and maps of all approved annexations through mid-April 2009.

4. LMIC Adjusted and Unadjusted municipality polygon files
Contain annexations performed on the state's municipalities. The annexation boundaries in the 'adjusted' file were geo-registered (adjusted) to Public Land Survey line data (see data source #5 below). The annexation boundaries in the 'unadjusted' file were not geo-registered to the PLS data set.

5.  Control Point Generated Public Land Survey Quarter-quarter Sections
Used to georeference some of the annexation boundaries. Documented at: https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/plan-mndnr-public-land-survey

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Condensed Update History:

UPDATE: July 27, 2011
-Number of records changed from 2748 to 2747 due to City of Tenney dissolution to Campbell Township

-----------------------------------
UPDATE: June 2015
- City of Thomson consolidated into City of Carlton in Carlton County

----------------------------------- 
UPDATE: December 2015 
Changed the following attribute codes: 

Fcode = deleted 
GNIS_ID_I = deleted 
GNIS_ID_T = deleted (replaced with GNIS_ID) 
GNIS_ID = added, replaces GNIS_ID_T (is in text format, not integer) 

----------------------------------- 
UPDATE: June 2016 
- all approved MBA dockets were processed from January 1, 2016 to June 24, 2016 

- the number of records changed from 2743 to 2745 due to the following changes: 
1. Liberty township in Itasca County split into two unorganized territories: Unorganized 14925 and Unorganized 15025 
2. Raymond City expanded from Kandiyohi County into Chippewa County and a record was added for the new portion in Chippewa County. 

- Also, the following spelling corrections were made 

"Bankcroft" corrected to "Bancroft" - TOWNSHIP(GNIS = 663501) 
"Blakely" corrected to "Blakeley" - TOWNSHIP (GNIS = 663612)	
"Clover Leaf" corrected to "Cloverleaf" - TOWNSHIP (GNIS = 663838)	
"Fairhaven" corrected to "Fair Haven" - TOWNSHIP (GNIS = 664132)	
"Lac Qui Parle" corrected to "Lac qui Parle" - TOWNSHIP (GNIS = 664650)	
"OBrien corrected to "O'Brien" - TOWNSHIP (GNIS = 665196)	
"Windmere" corrected to "Windemere" - TOWNSHIP (GNIS = 666013)	
"Heikkila Lake" corrected to "Heikkala Lake" - UNORGANIZED TERRITORY (GNIS = 664441)	
"Pot Shot Lake" corrected to "Potshot Lake" - UNORGANIZED TERRITORY (GNIS = 665347)

-----------------------------------
Update: September 2017
Unorganized Territories that do not exist in the US Census database (they do not have a GNIS_ID) were created initially with (at the time) fictitious GNIS numbers.  These GNIS numbers were discovered to be real GNIS numbers that represent GNIS features outside of MN.  In order to lessen the potential for confusion, these GNIS numbers were updated with new fictitious unique GNIS numbers so they do not match any existing features:

Northwest Angle = 9999995
Rainy River = 9999996
Beltrami Forest = 9999997
Gull Lake (Crow Wing County) = 9999998
Gull Lake (Cass County)= 9999999

These features were previously Unorganized Territories with "fictitious" GNIS numbers but were discovered to have real GNIS numbers.  These features have been renamed/modified and are now assigned these GNIS_IDs:

Dean Lake = 663937
Lake Number 1 (previously "East Lake") = 664691
Lake Number 2 (previously "West Lake" and "Two Harbors" now merged together) = 664692
------------------------------------
UPDATE: December 31st 2017 
- all approved MBA dockets were processed from June 23, 2017 to December 31st 2017.  

Errors fixed in December 31st 2017 update: 

GNIS_ID for Westfield Township (Dodge County) was discovered to be incorrect (was 665963), it was updated appropriately to be 663374.  

During the June 2017 update, some CTUs were inadvertently assigned to an incorrect CTU_Type and/or appear in the wrong county.

Four known examples:
1. Fairfax (GNIS_ID 2394729) should be a City in Renville County, not a Township that appears in Polk County
2. Fairfax Township (GNIS_ID 664128) should be in Polk County, not St. Louis County
3. Fairfield (GNIS_ID 664130) should be a Township in Crow Wing County, not a City that appears in Renville County
4. Fairfield Township (GNIS_ID 664131) should be in Swift County, not Crow Wing County

The December 2016 version of the data was correct.  These errors were fixed in the boundary changes made through December 31, 2017.

------------------------------------
UPDATE: April 15th 2018

- all approved MBA dockets were processed from January 1st, 2018 to April 15th, 2018.  

- Lutsen Township (Cook County) annexed a portion of the Unorganized Territory of West Cook (locally approved 4-18-2017). This change does not have a corresponding MBA docket number.

- Many boundary geometry corrections to various CTU features were made and will continue to be made throughout the state in an effort to increase overall accuracy of the entire dataset.  Specific metadata will be made available in the coming iterations.  

------------------------------------
UPDATE: June 30th, 2019:

- all approved MBA dockets were processed as of June 30th, 2019.  
- Many general boundary improvements were made throughout the state where positional errors or inaccuracies were encountered.
-field names and overall data schema were updated to match enterprise SDE CTU data at MnDOT for ease of distribution</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref>None</indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>Polygon</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>State</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><spref><vertdef><altsys><altdatum>not applicable</altdatum><altunits>Not applicable</altunits></altsys><depthsys><depthdn>not applicable</depthdn><depthdu>Not applicable</depthdu></depthsys></vertdef><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><detailed><enttyp><enttypl>CTU attributes</enttypl><enttypds>MnDOT</enttypds></enttyp><attr><attrlabl>FID</attrlabl><attrdef>Unique identifier of the city, township or unorganized territory feature assigned automatically by ArcGIS, starting with 0</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs></attr><attr><attrlabl>COUNTY_GNIS_FEATURE_ID</attrlabl><attrdef>Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) MN County Feature ID</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Board on Geographic Names</attrdefs></attr><attr><attrlabl>COUNTY_NAME</attrlabl><attrdef>Name of MN County</attrdef><attrdefs>MnDOT</attrdefs></attr><attr><attrlabl>OBJECTID</attrlabl><attrdef>Unique identifier of the city, township or unorganized territory feature assigned automatically by ArcGIS, starting with 1</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs></attr><attr><attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl><attrdef>Geometry data of the city, township or unorganized territory feature</attrdef><attrdefs>Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><edom><edomv>Polygon</edomv></edom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>COUNTY_CODE</attrlabl><attrdef>2-digit MN County code for given feature</attrdef><attrdefs>MnDOT</attrdefs><attrdomv><rdom><rdommin>1</rdommin><rdommax>87</rdommax></rdom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>GNIS_FEATURE_ID</attrlabl><attrdef>Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) Feature Identification Number</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Board on Geographic Names</attrdefs><attrdomv><codesetd><codesetn>Geographic Names Information System</codesetn><codesets>https://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/</codesets></codesetd></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>FEATURE_NAME</attrlabl><attrdef>The name of the city, township or unorganized territory feature</attrdef><attrdefs>U.S. Board on Geographic Names</attrdefs></attr><attr><attrlabl>CTU_CLASS</attrlabl><attrdef>CTU Feature Type</attrdef><attrdefs>Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit</attrdefs><attrdomv><edom><edomv>CITY</edomv><edomvds>Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>TOWNSHIP</edomv><edomvds>Municipal Boundary Adjustment Unit</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>UNORGANIZED TERRITORY</edomv><edomvds>USGS</edomvds></edom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>POPULATION</attrlabl><attrdef>Population for given feature (where available)</attrdef><attrdefs>MN State Demographic Center</attrdefs></attr><attr><attrlabl>Acres</attrlabl><attrdef>Number of acres within the polygon</attrdef><attrdefs>Calculated</attrdefs></attr></detailed><overview><eaover>CTU codes are a subset of the full set of GNIS codes.
